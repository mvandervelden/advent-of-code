Solve Advent of Code puzzles in Python3.

Advent of Code 2025 has a 2 part puzzle each day for 12 days (1-12)

The website is https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/[1-12].

_Always check the puzzle first before proposing a solution!_

Each day's puzzle consists of 2 parts. We first solve 1, then unlock the second part. I will provide the second part, since it's locked under login.

The code is organized by day [1-12].py Input is organized in the same pattern [1-12].txt

The result should be run using `python3 [1-12].py`, it will print the results of both parts:

> Part 1: <Result Part 1>
> Part 2: <Result Part 2>

If the solution requires a specific library that is not installed, instruct me to install it (and telling me how).

The solutions should run in max a couple of seconds.

If I'm asking for a visualization, it means I want to visualize the calculation process. It should be done on part 2, and activated by a parameter `--visualize` or `-v`. It should be visualized using ascii, and clearing screen between passes so it doesn't create an endless output stream. It should run in max 10 seconds (so don't wait too long between passes). Be creative in how to visualize the calculation in a fun way!
