# Advent of Code Solutions by Maarten: 2016 - current

This repo contains solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) coding challenge, for each year from 2016 to present day.

The solutions are done in Swift, using different techniques. There's no guarantee that old solutions still work on present-day Swift.
Check the code per year for more information on how to compile/run the code.
Solutions are mostly not complete, and might not be optimal. I tend to try to document things nicely, but get sloppy as we get farther into the challenge.
